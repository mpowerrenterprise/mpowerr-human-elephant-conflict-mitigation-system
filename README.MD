## 01 Introduction

The human-elephant conflict is a persistent issue in Sri Lanka, where elephants are integral to the country's natural beauty and tourism industry. Due to this conflict, several lives and properties have been lost in rural areas of the country. The Sri Lankan government has been using electric fences to prevent elephants from entering villages, but it is unreliable.

An Artificial Intelligence-based Human Elephant Conflict Mitigation System has been developed to address the persistent issue of human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka. The system employs CCTV cameras and wildlife camera traps to detect elephants in video frames and subsequently sends early warning messages to the corresponding village authorities to take appropriate actions. Furthermore, the system implements external methods, such as artificial sounds of buzzing bees and firecrackers, to discourage elephants from entering village areas.

The system is designed to provide efficient results during the day and nighttime, and it includes features like elephant detection, early warning SMS/email, and a HECMS Management System dashboard. The system also updates the conflict information in the database to be analyzed by the conflicts management team.

The system aims to lead Sri Lankan communities in technology to be more powerful and productive to have beautiful lives for everyone. The ultimate goal of this project is to mitigate human-elephant conflicts and promote a sustainable solution for the issue.

## 03 System Architecture

This section presents an overview of the system architecture for the Artificial Intelligence-based Human Elephant Conflict Mitigation System. The system architecture comprises various elements, including diagrams, flowcharts, components, UML use-case and class diagrams, ER-Diagrams, etc.

### 3.1 Architecture Diagram

![Architecture Diagram](docs/github-readme-content/architecture-diagram.png)

There is a “Head Office” on the right side of the diagram, which means they will use the HECMS Management System, and all the conflict incidents data will be transferred to it and can be analyzed and accessed by the Head Office.

On the left side, there are two zones presented as examples, “Habarana Zone” and “Anuradhapura Zone” (Popular elephant conflict places in Sri Lanka), and each zone has a device admin. That device admin has basic access to the HECMS Management System through the Device Admin account. Each zone has a HECMS Monitoring System installed on a computing device that processes video frames to check elephant presence. If elephants are detected, it will send an SMS to the corresponding villager and an email to “Head Office,” The incident data will be transmitted to HECMS Management System. Those can be accessed by “Head Office” and that device admin.In the middle, the database is shared between Management and HECMS Monitoring Systems to proceed with the granted operations.

### 3.2 Structure Diagram

![Structure Diagram](docs/github-readme-content/structure-diagram.jpg)

The above structured-based architecture diagram clearly explains how the Human Element Conflict Mitigation System (HECMS) functions structurally. HECMS is divided into two main sub-systems: the HECMS Monitoring System and the HECMS Management System.

Both systems have a shared database in the middle, and their main functionalities are also clearly mentioned; the HECMS Monitoring System’s primary functions are Elephant detection, SMS sending, Email Sending, artificial sound playing, and database updating, and the HECMS Management System’s functions are analyzed data, manage data, and create new devices, etc.

### 3.3 Elephant Detection Process Flowchart

![Elephant Detection Process Flowchart](docs/github-readme-content/flowchart-elephant-detection.png)

This flowchart explains how the elephant model detection functions. First, it gets the video stream as the input source; then, it will be transmitted to the next layer to break the video into frames. A frame will be sent to the preprocessing unit to clean up, and then inverts the frame into a numerical vector. The frame will be thrown to the neural network for processing, and then it outputs the confidence value; if the confidence value is greater than or equal to the threshold value, it is considered a positive prediction, and then the system will play artificial sound, send SMS, email, and update database; otherwise, the system processes each frame one by one in a looping manner.

### 3.4 ER Diagram

![ER Diagram](docs/github-readme-content/er-diagram.png)

The ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram explains the structure of the database system in a graphical way; it is the visual representation of the database functions, attributes, and relationships between tables.

The above diagram clearly defines three main tables: Device, Data, and User Accounts. The Data table contains detection data, the Device table includes the HECMS Monitoring System’s device data, and the User Account table contains the user account details. This is the shared database utilized by both systems Monitoring and HECMS Management Systems.

### 3.5 Use Case Diagram

![Use Case Diagram](docs/github-readme-content/use-case-diagram.png)

The Use Case Diagram is a Unified Modeling Language (UML) behavioral diagram that represents the Elephant Conflict Mitigation System's interactions between users (Super Admin and Device Admin). The Use Case Diagram can illustrate the system's different use cases or functionalities and the users who interact with the system.

### 3.6 Workflow Diagram

![Use Case Diagram](docs/github-readme-content/workflow.png)

## 04 Setup

This section covers how to set up the human-elephant conflicts mitigation system; this system consists of two main sub-systems: the HECMS Monitoring System and the HECMS Management System. The HECMS Monitoring System is the video processor component that could be installed on a computing device in the jungle to identify elephants; the HECMS Management System is an analytics system used by the conflicts management team to analyze the incident data. This section shows how to install the necessary dependencies to set it up successfully.

### 4.1 Setup HECMS Monitoring System

This project has been designed to operate on both CPU and GPU environments. Utilizing a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) with CUDA-Enabled technology will enhance the application's performance, allowing faster processing times.

If a GPU is unavailable on the target computer, the system can still be installed and run on the CPU. However, it is essential to note that processing times may be significantly slower when using a CPU than a GPU.

Even though the target computer has a GPU, it is necessary to install CUDA and CUDDN to enable GPU support for TensorFlow. Otherwise, the GPU cannot be utilized but can be run on the CPU.

#### 4.1.1 Installing CUDA & CUDDN (Optional)

It is highly recommended to skip the CUDA & CUDDN installation if the target computer does not have a GPU, as the system can still operate on the CPU. However, it is essential to note that this may result in slower processing times.

Suppose the target computer has a GPU. But if it is chosen not to install CUDA & CUDDN, it is still possible to skip the installation. However, the system can only utilize the CPU power, even though a hardware-based GPU is available. Therefore, CUDA & CUDDN is similar to drivers that enable GPU support.

It is highly recommended to install CUDA & CUDDN if the target computer has a GPU to enable faster processing. The installation steps of CUDA & CUDDN are provided below.

##### Step 01: Checking suitable CUDA & CUDDN verions for TensorFlow.

Check Here:- [https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu)

![TensorFlow Versions](docs/github-readme-content/tensorflow-version.jpg)

The system uses TensorFlow version 2.7.0. To successfully install TensorFlow (version 2.7.0), it is necessary first to install CUDA (version 8.1), followed by CUDDN (version 11.2), as indicated in the accompanying chart. Other versions of TensorFlow might be supported. However, version 2.7.0 is highly recommended; it was tested and developed with this version.

It is important to note that the the above chart provides clear instructions on the appropriate versions of CUDA and CUDDN to install for compatibility with the selected version of TensorFlow.

Accordingly, the installation process should commence with the installation of CUDA, followed by the installation of CUDDN, to ensure that the TensorFlow installation is successful and fully compatible with the selected versions of these dependencies.

##### Step 02: Installing CUDA (Ver: 8.1)

Download CUDA From Here:- [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)

![TensorFlow Versions](docs/github-readme-content/cuda-version.jpg)

Download and install the appropriate CUDA version from the official website of NVIDIA. The installation process is simple and can be installed with the GUI.

![TensorFlow Versions](docs/github-readme-content/cuda-install.png)

##### Step 03: Installing CUDDN (Ver: 11.2)

Download CUDDN From Here:- [https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive)

![TensorFlow Versions](docs/github-readme-content/cuddn-install.jpg)

Download and install the appropriate CUDDN version from the official website of NVIDIA. This time, the installation process could be more challenging.

01.Download and Extract CUDDN zip.

02.There are 3 following folders in it.

```
- bin
- include
- lib
```

03.Open the CUDA Installation directory (WHERE is the CUDA installed) Ex: (C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.2)

![TensorFlow Versions](docs/github-readme-content/cuda-install2.png)

04.Copy all content from "bin", "include", "lib" folders from the extracted CUDDN zip to the installed CUDA directory's bin, include, lib. An example is shown above.

##### Step 04: Add CUDA & CUDDN Path to the environment variable.

After successfully installing CUDA and CUDDN, it is important to add their respective paths to the environment variable on your PC. This will ensure that the system is able to locate and use these dependencies when running TensorFlow applications.

01.Add the following path to the environment variable.

- Bin Path
- Libnvp Path

`C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.2\bin`

`C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.2\libnvvp\`

![TensorFlow Versions](docs/github-readme-content/env-path.jpg)

##### Step 05: Check CUDA & CUDDN installed successfully.

- Open CMD and Type

  ```
    nvidia-smi
  ```

  ![TensorFlow Versions](docs/github-readme-content/check-cuda-install.jpg)

**Note:** If it shows like above, that means CUDA & CUDDN have been installed successfully.

#### 4.1.2 Installing Dependencies

This section shows how to install the dependencies easily using the **Anaconda environment** from the requirements.yml. It makes it easy to manage dependencies and create reproducible environments for the projects.

##### **Step 01: Install Anaconda**

The first step is to install Anaconda on the deployed computer: Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python programming language and a collection of pre-built packages and tools for data science and machine learning. It includes a package manager called "conda" that simplifies the installation and management of packages and dependencies.

- Official Website: https://www.anaconda.com/

##### **Step 02: Navigate to the requirements.yml file directory**

The requirements.yml file is found under this project folder; it could be in the following directory named "environment.yml". Navigate to that directory in CMD.

```
human-elephant-conflict-mitigation-system/source/0-resources/1-requirements/environment.yml
```

- **The requirements file link:** **[environment.yml](source/0-resources/1-requirements/environment.yml)**

##### **Step 03: Install the requirements**

**To Install:** After the navigation to the above directory in CMD then issue the following command to install it; An example screenshot is shown below.

```
 conda env create -f environment.yml
```

- Example screenshot:

- <img src="docs/github-readme-content/install-anaconda-dependencies.jpg" alt="Install using Anaconda Environment" style="border: 1px solid black;">

**IMPORTANT:** It will take some time to install all the dependencies automatically; after the installation, an environment will be created with the name "tensorflow_gpu" that environment contains all the required libraries; when running the HECMS Monitoring System, **always make sure to activate that environment** which has necessary libraries.

**To activate:** Use the following command.

```
activate tensorflow_gpu
```

**Note:** After the activation, the project can be run on top of that environment.

##### Additional Information

There is some additional information below to learn more about the Anaconda environment.

- To Install Anaconda Environment

```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
```

- To Export Anaconda Environment

```
  conda env export > environment.yml
```

- To Delete Anaconda Environment

```
  conda env remove -n ENV_NAME
```

- To Create an Anaconda Environment

```
  conda create -n ENV_NAME python=3.9
```

#### 4.1.3 Setting up Database

##### 4.1.3.1 Setup Database

The Monitoring and HECMS Management Systems use the same database to communicate with each other. Therefore, setting up the database first is essential to make both systems work successfully.

To set the database locally, it is recommended to use the XAMPP control panel; there is a MySQL database engine and PHPMyAdmin with it. The database can be found on the following directory.

```
human-elephant-conflict-mitigation-system/source/0-resources/hecms.sql
```

**IMPORTANT:** Give the database name as **hecms**.

![MySQL Database](docs/github-readme-content/setup-database.jpg)

##### 4.1.3.2 Configure Database

This step configures the database with the HECMS Monitoring System; suppose the database is hosted remotely. Letting the HECMS Monitoring System know the credentials and the host is essential. Open the JSON file in the following directory to provide the database credentials and host information.

```
human-elephant-conflict-mitigation-system/source/1-hecms-monitoring-system/assets/credentials/database-credentials.json
```

![MySQL Database Credentials](docs/github-readme-content/database-configure.jpg)

**IMPORTANT:** If the system hosted locally with XAMPP, leave the credentials as same. During the running time of the HECMS Monitoring System, it sends incident information to this database; if the database is hosted somewhere other than localhost, it is important to edit this file.

#### 4.1.4 Setting up Email Sever

**Note:** The HECMS Monitoring System sends emails to the authorities regarding the incidents, to make this function work properly, it is crucial to set up a Google SMTP Email server. Below, the step-by-step guides on setting up the Google SMTP server are provided.

**Step 01:** Choose or create an Google Email to use as a sender: (Ex: hecms_alert@gmail.com)

**Step 02:** Turn on the 2-Step Verification method to allow the email to send mails programmatically.

- <img src="docs/github-readme-content/turn-on-two-factor.jpg" data-canonical-src="github-readme-content/turn-on-two-factor.jpg"/>

**Note 1:** There are some basic process to turn on the two factor authentication, after turning on, follow the step 3.

**Step 03:** Craete an app password | after creating app password, SMTP server can be setup.

- <img src="docs/github-readme-content/set-app-password.jpg" data-canonical-src="github-readme-content/app-password.jpg"/>

- <img src="docs/github-readme-content/create-app-password.jpg" data-canonical-src="github-readme-content/create-app-password.jpg"/>

- <img src="docs/github-readme-content/app-password.jpg" data-canonical-src="github-readme-content/app-password.jpg"/>

Step 04: Enter the app password and the sender email address in the following JSON file:

```
human-elephant-conflict-mitigation-system/source/1-hecms-monitoring-system/assets/credentials/api-credentials.json
```

<img src="docs/github-readme-content/setup-email-smtp-credentials.jpg" />

**Note:** Update the email and password under the "google_smtp_server" node.

#### 4.1.5 Setting up SMS Gateway

**Note:** The HECMS Monitoring System sends SMS alert to the villagers regarding the incidents, to make this function work properly, it is crucial to set up a SMS gateway. There are many SMS gateways out there. However, this system uses notify.lk (https://www.notify.lk/) gateway, which is cheap and affordable to use in Sri Lanka.

**IMPORTANT:** Update the gateway credentials in the following JSON file.

```
human-elephant-conflict-mitigation-system/source/1-hecms-monitoring-system/assets/credentials/api-credentials.json
```

<img src="docs/github-readme-content/setup-sms-gateway-credentials.jpg" />

**NOTE:** The notify.lk uses direct endpoints: type GET or POST, a sample format is shown bellow.

```
https://app.notify.lk/api/v1/send?user_id=[USER_ID]&api_key=[API_KEY]&sender_id=NotifyDEMO&to=[TO]&message=Test
```

**Note:** If you choose to use a different SMS gateway, it is your responsibility to write code according to that; different SMS gateway has different sort of code/library. You must find the documentation for the gateway you are using and follow the instructions.

Below are the codes for sending SMS; you can change them according to your selected gateway; if you choose any gateway similar to a direct endpoint instead of a library-based one, you can simply add the key and secret. Otherwise, it is your responsibility to write code.

```
human-elephant-conflict-mitigation-system/source/1-hecms-monitoring-system/utilities.py
```

<img src="docs/github-readme-content/sms-gateway.png" />

### 4.2 Setup HECMS Management System

#### 4.2.1 Hosting

This section explains how to set up the HECMS Management System. It is built with Laravel and can be configured quickly on shared hosting or any apache-based servers that run on PHP.

To host it locally on a computer, XAMPP control panel can be used for that. XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends; we can use it for local deployment of PHP-based projects.

Official Website: https://www.apachefriends.org/

**IMPORTANT 1:** The soruce code of the HECMS Management System is found under the following directory

```
human-elephant-conflict-mitigation-system/source/2-hecms-management-system
```

**IMPORTANT 2:** Projects that are built with Laravel can be accessed by opening the public folder, in the source code of HECMS Management System, there is a folder called public, if that opened, it could be accessed, otherwise it won't work, when deploying on servers, it is very important to point to that folder instead of pointing on index.php/index.html.

#### 4.2.2 Configure Database

**IMPORTANT 1:** The HECMS Monitoring and the HECMS Management Systems use a central database (hecms.sql). The database setting up process is already shown in the above section. If you plan to host the system remotely, hosting the database in MySQL remote engine is essential, you also have to configure the database credentials according to that in the HECMS Monitoring System as shown in the "4.1.3.2 Configure Database" section of "4.2 Setup HECMS Management System".

**IMPORTANT 2:** If you want to configure the HECMS Management System database credentials, edit the following env file.

```
human-elephant-conflict-mitigation-system/source/2-hecms-management-system/.env
```

<img src="docs/github-readme-content/setup-database-management-system.jpg" />

In order to install the object detection framework, clone the following repository. This repo contains Google Research of TensorFlow and Object Detection essential Contents.

Clone this Google models repository:- [https://github.com/tensorflow/models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models)

This repo is large. it contains almost all files of the TensorFlow and Google Object Detection Framework researches, we should install it manually to utilize the object detection framework.

- Clone models repo

  ```
    git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
  ```

Now, we have to download Protobuf to convert the serialize structured data.

Download Protobuf:- [https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases)

01.Extract it.

02.Copy the protoc.exe and paste it under the cloned repo (models/research) folder.

- From models/research folder, Execute the following code in CMD

  ```
    protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
  ```

  03.To install the object detection manually, copy the setup.py that is under (models/research/object_detection/packages/tf2/setup.py) and paste in the (models/research) folder.

- Install object detection manually from (models/research).

  ```
    pip install -e .
  ```
